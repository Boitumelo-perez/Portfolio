            <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
            <label>
            This is a Tic Tac Toe Game informally known as X-O.
            Built this game using Java Swing and Gui from Netbeans
            IDE enabling to create a seamless UI using drag and drop.
            The purpose of this app was a Project for school, a game 
            just reminded me why I even began programming after all
